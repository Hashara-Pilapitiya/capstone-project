IntegraAllay is a cutting-edge server designed to revolutionize integration testing for front-end developers. Our platform empowers developers to create mock back-end services, simulate API responses, and thoroughly test their front-end applications. In situations where the actual back-end is under development, undergoing maintenance, or simply not available for testing, IntegraAllay steps in as a reliable solution.

## Features
ðŸ’ <b>Mock Back-End Services </b></br>
These two aspects of the software development experience are reflected by the integration feature in IntegraAllay, which represent a very progression in the web application submission process or services that need front-end and back-end engagement.</br>
ðŸ’ <b>Customizable Responses</b></br>
The "Mocking" function in IntegraAllay has a potential to do a lot in the automation process as it gives programmers an opportunity to create their own responses that can later be used for testing purposes.</br>
ðŸ’ <b>Request Specification</b></br>
The declarative API feature which is a part of IntegraAllay is of high importance in assisting the emerging alignment and teamwork between back-end and front-end development teams by giving the developers an ability to indicate and specify API requests within the testing environment. </br>
ðŸ’ <b>User Interface Testing</b></br>
Such a feature in IntegraAllay is of vital importance as, among other things, developers are given the opportunity to most comprehensively evaluate a software by fully assessing the functionality and user experience of its front-end interface.</br>
ðŸ’ <b>Flexibility and Independence</b></br>
This component of IntegraAllay demonstrates significant technological advancement in the realm of development approaches, namely integrating front-end and back-end applications.</br>
